        Today's world textile and garment trade is valued at a staggering $425
        billion. We are told that under the pressure of increasing
        globalisation, it is India and China that are the new world
        manufacturing powerhouses. However, this is not a new phenomenon: until
        the industrial revolution, Asia manufactured great quantities of
        colourful printed cottons that were sold to places as far afield as
        Japan, West Africa and Europe. Cotton explores this earlier globalised
        economy and its transformation after 1750 as cotton led the way in the
        industrialisation of Europe. By the early nineteenth century, India,
        China and the Ottoman Empire switched from world producers to buyers of
        European cotton textiles, a position that they retained for over two
        hundred years. This is a fascinating and insightful story which ranges
        from Asian and European technologies and African slavery to cotton
        plantations in the Americas and consumer desires across the globe.
