        <strong>The Great Divergence</strong> brings new insight to one of the
        classic questions of history: Why did sustained industrial growth begin
        in Northwest Europe, despite surprising similarities between advanced
        areas of Europe and East Asia? As Ken Pomeranz shows, as recently as
        1750, parallels between these two parts of the world were very high in
        life expectancy, consumption, product and factor markets, and the
        strategies of households. Perhaps most surprisingly, Pomeranz
        demonstrates that the Chinese and Japanese cores were no worse off
        ecologically than Western Europe. Core areas throughout the
        eighteenth-century Old World faced comparable local shortages of
        land-intensive products, shortages that were only partly resolved by
        trade.

        Pomeranz argues that Europe's nineteenth-century divergence from the Old
        World owes much to the fortunate location of coal, which substituted for
        timber. This made Europe's failure to use its land intensively much less
        of a problem, while allowing growth in energy-intensive industries.
        Another crucial difference that he notes has to do with trade.
        Fortuitous global conjunctures made the Americas a greater source of
        needed primary products for Europe than any Asian periphery. This
        allowed Northwest Europe to grow dramatically in population, specialize
        further in manufactures, and remove labor from the land, using increased
        imports rather than maximizing yields. Together, coal and the New World
        allowed Europe to grow along resource-intensive, labor-saving paths.

        Meanwhile, Asia hit a cul-de-sac. Although the East Asian hinterlands
        boomed after 1750, both in population and in manufacturing, this growth
        prevented these peripheral regions from exporting vital resources to the
        cloth-producing Yangzi Delta. As a result, growth in the core of East
        Asia's economy essentially stopped, and what growth did exist was forced
        along labor-intensive, resource-saving paths--paths Europe could have
        been forced down, too, had it not been for favorable resource stocks
        from underground and overseas.
