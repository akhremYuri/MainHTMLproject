        When we think about the origins of modern science we usually begin in
        Europe. We remember the great minds of Nicolaus Copernicus, Isaac
        Newton, Charles Darwin, and Albert Einstein. But the history of science
        is not, and has never been, a uniquely European endeavor. Copernicus
        relied on mathematical techniques that came from Arabic and Persian
        texts. Newtonâ€™s laws of motion used astronomical observations made in
        Asia and Africa. When Darwin was writing On the Origin of Species, he
        consulted a sixteenth-century Chinese encyclopedia. And when Einstein
        studied quantum mechanics, he was inspired by the Bengali physicist,
        Satyendra Nath Bose.
