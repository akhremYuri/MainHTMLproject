          <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/bibles/bible-versions/english-standard-version" target="_blank">The English Standard Version</a> is a literal translation of the Bible, firmly rooted in the tradition of Tyndale and King James but without archaic language. Published at the beginning of the 21st century, it is extremely close to the Revised Standard Version and is well suited to public reading and memorisation.

          <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/by/bibles/bible-versions/king-james-version" target="_blank">The King James Version</a> is the world's most widely known Bible translation, using early seventeenth-century English. Its powerful, majestic style has made it a literary classic, with many of its phrases and expressions embedded in our language. Earlier generations were 'brought up' with this translation and learnt many of its verses by heart.
